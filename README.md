ffmpeg_input
============

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) を利用した AviUtl 用の入力プラグインです。  
以下のような特徴があります。

- `movie-ffmpeg.mp4` などのようにファイル名が `-ffmpeg` が終わるものしか読み込まない
  - L-SMASH Works との併用を想定しており、ファイル名によって使い分けができます
- 巨大なファイルの読み込みがそれなりに速い代わりにシークが不正確
  - 精度が重要な場合は従来通り L-SMASH Works をご利用ください
  - ファイル内容やカット地点によって影響の大きさは変わると思われます
- InputPipePlugin 相当の機能を最初から内包
  - AviUtl のメモリ空間を必要以上に圧迫しません
- 64bit 版の ffmpeg を利用
  - プロセスを分離するついでに 64bit で動作します
  - ライセンス周辺の諸問題をクリアするために OpenH264 を動的リンクした LGPL 版の ffmpeg を別リポジトリに用意
    https://github.com/oov/ffmpeg-openh264-win/releases

ffmpeg_input の動作には AviUtl version 1.00 以降と拡張編集 version 0.92 以降が必要です。

なお、このプラグインの作成には [AviUtlFFmpegDecoder](https://github.com/kusaanko/AviUtlFFmpegDecoder) を大いに参考にさせて頂きました。  
この場を借りてお礼申し上げます。

注意事項
--------

ffmpeg_input は無保証で提供されます。  
ffmpeg_input を使用したこと及び使用しなかったことによるいかなる損害について、開発者は責任を負いません。

これに同意できない場合、あなたは ffmpeg_input を使用することができません。

ダウンロード
------------

https://github.com/oov/aviutl_ffmpeg_input/releases

インストール
------------

導入には ffmpeg などを別途用意する必要があります。  
以下がインストール手順です。

1. `ffmpeg_input.64aui` と `ffmpeg_input-brdg64.aui` を、  
   `aviutl.exe` と同じ場所か、`plugins` フォルダー内のどちらか一方に配置
2. プラグインを配置した場所に `ffmpeg64` という名前のフォルダーを作り、  
   以下から `ffmpeg-5.X, LGPL, win64-shared` をダウンロードして解凍、すべて配置  
   （`ffmpeg64` の直下に `LICENSE.txt` があり、`bin` フォルダー内に DLL などがあればOK）  
   https://github.com/oov/ffmpeg-openh264-win/releases  
   ※ここ以外の配布品でも動作しますが、GPL 版は使用しないでください（ライセンス上の問題）
3. 上記のページ内にある `OpenH264 vX.X.X` のリンクを踏み、飛んだ先のページから  
   `openh264-X.X.X-win64.dll.bz2` をダウンロードして解凍、配置します  
   （`ffmpeg64\bin\openh264-X.X.X-win64.dll` に置けばOK）  
   bz2 の解凍には [7-zip](https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/) が使えます
4. 配置したファイルがセキュリティソフトにブロックされないよう、適切に除外設定を行ってください
5. AviUtl のメニューから `ファイル`→`環境設定`→`入力プラグイン優先度の設定` を選び、  
   `ffmpeg Video Reader Bridge` を `L-SMASH Works File Reader` や `InputPipePlugin` より上に配置してください

設定
----

`ファイル`→`環境設定`→`入力プラグインの設定`→`ffmpeg Video Reader Bridgeの設定` を選ぶと設定ダイアログが表示されます。

### 優先するデコーダー

優先的に使用したいデコーダーがある場合に、それらをカンマで区切って指定します。  
先に書いたものが優先されます。

例えば `h264_cuvid,h264_qsv` と指定すると、`h264` のファイルを読み込もうとしたときに `h264_cuvid` で開き、それに失敗した場合は `h264_qsv` で開きます。

### カラーフォーマット変換時のスケーリングアルゴリズム

これは通常の拡大縮小時の処理が変わる設定ではありません。  
初期設定である `fast bilinear` は速度と品質のバランスが良いアルゴリズムです。


特殊な使い方
------------

- `ffmpeg_input-brdg64.aui` を `ffmpeg_input.aui` にリネームすると、プロセス分離を行わずに動作するようになります。  
  ただしこの場合、動作には `ffmpeg32` フォルダーに 32bit 版の ffmpeg を用意する必要があります。
- `ffmpeg_input-brdg64.aui` を `ffmpeg_input-brdg32.aui` にリネームし、更にこのファイルをコピーして  
  `ffmpeg_input.32aui` という名前で配置すると、32bit 版 ffmpeg でプロセス分離できます。

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
